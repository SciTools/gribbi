What's new in iris-grib v0.13
=============================

:Release: 0.13.0
:Date: T.B.D.

Features
--------

* Added saving of data on Hybrid Pressure levels (surface type 119 in
  code table 4.5).

* Added loading and saving of data on Hybrid Height levels (surface type 118 in
  code table 4.5).

* Added loading for data using Mercator projection (grid definition
  template 10 in template table 3.1)

* Added saving for data on irregular, non-rotated grids (grid definition
  template 4 in template table 3.1)

  .. note::

      Loading and saving for the Mercator projection is only available using
      iris versions greater than 2.1.0.


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a bug with loading data on Hybrid Pressure levels (surface types 105
  and 119 in code table 4.5).  
  Previously, *all* hybrid coordinate values, in both 'level_pressure' and
  'sigma' coordinates, were loaded from the next level up,
  i.e. (model_level_number + 1).

  .. note::

      This changes loading behaviour for data on hybrid pressure levels only.
      This is an incompatible change, but the coefficent values previously
      returned were essentially useless, with some values missing.
